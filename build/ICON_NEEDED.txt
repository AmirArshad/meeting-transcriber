Icon Required for Build
========================

To complete the installer build, you need to provide an icon file:

Location: build/icon.ico
Format: Windows ICO format
Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256

You can create an .ico file from a PNG using online tools like:
- https://convertio.co/png-ico/
- https://www.icoconverter.com/

Alternatively, use a professional design tool or hire a designer.

For now, you can use a placeholder icon generator or download a free icon.

The build will fail without this file!
