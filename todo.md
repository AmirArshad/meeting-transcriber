# Next Project Decision

Previous project plan was archived to `docs/internal/TODO_ARCHIVE_2026-05-18_LOCAL_AI_ADDONS.md`.

## Candidate projects

- [ ] Acoustic echo cancellation / echo suppression for speaker-use scenarios (cross-platform Windows + macOS).
- [ ] Upload audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.opus`) and process them through the same transcription/summary/history flow as recorded meetings.
- [ ] History chat over past meetings using the installed local summary runtime/model.

## Recommendation

- [ ] Start with **Acoustic echo cancellation / suppression** first.
  - Reason: highest recording/transcript quality impact for speaker users, and it improves core output quality before adding new ingestion/query features.

## Decision gate

- [ ] Confirm the next project to execute.
- [ ] Create a focused implementation plan once the project is chosen.
