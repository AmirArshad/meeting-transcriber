# Project TODO

Active TODOs only. Completed dependency-upgrade phase history has been removed from this file; use git history and `docs/development/DEPENDABOT_TRIAGE.md` for background.

## Completed: macOS arm64 ffmpeg + bundle trim (merged)

Replaced Intel-only evermeet.cx ffmpeg with a pinned Apple Silicon static build (fixes macOS 26.4+ Rosetta deprecation warnings). Trimmed the packaged macOS Python runtime by removing `torch` and other MLX-unused PyTorch baggage after `pip install`. Packaged app ~800 MB (down from ~1.3 GB); manual smoke passed (record, Opus encode, MLX transcription, playback).

- [x] [Risk: Low] Pin arm64 ffmpeg download (shaka-project/static-ffmpeg-binaries n8.0.1-1) with SHA-256 verification.
- [x] [Risk: Low] CI: assert bundled `Contents/Resources/ffmpeg/ffmpeg` is arm64 via `file`.
- [x] [Risk: Medium] Post-install removal of `torch` + transitive PyTorch-only packages; keep `scipy` (required by MLX).
- [x] [Risk: Medium] CI packaged smoke: `scripts/verify-macos-packaged-app.sh` (arm64 ffmpeg, codesign, libopus encode, MLX imports, no bundled torch, `du -sh`).
- [x] [Risk: High] Manual macOS smoke: record → Opus via packaged ffmpeg → short MLX transcription on a real Mac.
- [ ] [Risk: Low] Apple Developer signing/notarization: enable when enrolled (`package.json` `mac.notarize`, release workflow secrets).
- [ ] [Risk: High] Evaluate PyObjC `Cocoa` / `Quartz` pin removal (separate follow-up; needs capture smoke).

## Remaining Dependency And Release Hygiene

- [x] [Risk: Low] Close superseded Dependabot PRs that were absorbed by the dependency-upgrade branch: #12 and #20.
- [x] [Risk: Low] Close deferred high-risk Dependabot PRs with explicit comments: #15, #18, and #19.
- [x] [Risk: Medium] Decide whether optional follow-up dependency PRs #13, #14, #16, #17, and #21 should ship as small separate PRs or stay deferred. (Closed; revisit only if Dependabot reopens with newer bumps.)
- [ ] [Risk: Low] Trial dropping explicit transitive-only pins in a follow-up trim pass; keep any pin needed for reproducible packaged builds.
- [ ] [Risk: High] Evaluate whether macOS PyObjC `Cocoa` / `Quartz` pins are removable; requires `pip check`, PyObjC import checks, packaged `build:mac:dir`, and ScreenCaptureKit fallback smoke.
- [x] [Risk: Medium] Remove bundled macOS `torch` after pip install (MLX path does not import it; diarization installs its own torch into userData).
- [ ] [Risk: Medium] Investigate Windows faster-whisper transitive packages such as `onnxruntime`, `tokenizers`, and `av`; remove only if the packaged transcription graph remains valid.

## Remaining Validation And Smoke Checks

- [x] [Risk: High] macOS packaged smoke: launch `dist/mac-arm64/AvaNevis.app` and run a short MLX transcription after `npm run build:mac:dir`.
- [ ] [Risk: High] Windows packaged smoke: healthy CUDA runtime transcribes on GPU.
- [ ] [Risk: High] Windows packaged smoke: broken CUDA runtime falls back to CPU and still saves a transcript.
- [ ] [Risk: Medium] Recovery smoke: existing `.opus` without transcript appears in History and can be retried.
- [ ] [Risk: High] Optional extended pass: `tests/manual/recording-transcription-regression-checklist.md`.
- [ ] [Risk: High] Optional local AI add-ons smoke if models are installed: diarization and summary subset from `tests/manual/local-ai-addons-checklist.md`.

## Next: decide product / validation priority

Codebase refactor initiative is **complete** (Phases 0–8 + Phase 5B + shared `recorder_stdout`; see section below). Pick the next project from remaining smoke debt or the product backlog.

Recommended order when choosing:

1. **Hardware smoke debt** (when a Mac / CUDA Windows box is available) — Phase 7B macOS capture smoke; Windows CUDA GPU + CPU-fallback packaged smokes.
2. **Product feature** — decide among upload-audio, history chat, AEC, or stream-to-disk (see Deferred Product backlog).
3. **Release hygiene** — notarization when enrolled; optional transitive pin / PyObjC trim (needs capture smoke).

Do **not** force Phase 2 renderer controllers now. Revisit only if `app.js` grows materially or a feature forces controller-level changes — and only after (1) a DOM-testing decision and (2) a written Pattern C shared-state ownership plan.

## Deferred Product And Architecture Backlog

- [ ] [Risk: High] Acoustic echo cancellation / echo suppression for speaker-use scenarios on Windows and macOS.
- [ ] [Risk: Medium] Upload audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.opus`) and process them through the transcription, summary, and history flow.
- [ ] [Risk: Medium] History chat over past meetings using the installed local summary runtime/model.
- [ ] [Risk: High] Stream-to-disk during capture to reduce long-recording memory pressure.
- [ ] [Risk: Medium] Verify the archived "packaged Swift helper skips `which()` when `AVANEVIS_PACKAGED=1`" item is fully implemented and tested; close if redundant with current `test_screencapture_helper.py` coverage.

## Completed: AvaNevis Codebase Refactor

Design doc: `docs/initiatives/AVANEVIS_CODEBASE_REFACTOR.md`. Merged through #47 (2026-07-09). Initiative complete; soft-cap accepted for `app.js`.

- [x] Phases 0–8 (characterization → CI/docs), Phase 5B (`hf_runtime` + `audio_prep`), shared `backend/audio/recorder_stdout.py` (#47).
- [x] Phase 2 pure helpers only; **controllers stay deferred** (re-measure: ~4.3k lines; ~600–900 line save still misses ~2k soft-cap; no DOM/controller behavioral tests). Soft-cap acceptance stands.
- [ ] Residual (not blocking initiative exit): Phase 7B macOS capture smoke when Mac hardware is available — `docs/initiatives/phase-0-smoke-baseline.md`.
