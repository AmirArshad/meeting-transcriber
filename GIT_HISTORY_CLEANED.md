### 🚀 Next Steps for Publishing

Since you haven't pushed to a public repo yet, you're good to go!

**To publish on GitHub:**

1. **Create new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Name: `meeting-transcriber`
   - Description: "AI-powered meeting transcription with desktop audio capture"
   - Public ✅
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

2. **Push your cleaned history:**
   ```bash
   # Add GitHub as remote
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meeting-transcriber.git

   # Push all branches
   git push -u origin --all

   # Push all tags (if any)
   git push -u origin --tags
   ```

3. **Your repository is now public with privacy! 🎉**

## Troubleshooting

### If GitHub rejects the push

**Problem:** "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work..."

**Solution:**
```bash
# Force push (safe because repo isn't public yet)
git push -f origin master
```

### If you need to update an existing remote

**Problem:** Already had origin set to old repo

**Solution:**
```bash
# Remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meeting-transcriber.git

# Push
git push -u origin --all
```

---

## Verification Commands

**Check your email is private:**
```bash
git log --all --pretty=format:"%ae" | sort -u
# Should only show: shareh@users.noreply.github.com
```

**Check commit count:**
```bash
git rev-list --count HEAD
# Should show: 14
```

**Check current config:**
```bash
git config user.email
# Should show: shareh@users.noreply.github.com
```
