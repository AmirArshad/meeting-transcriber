# Audio Recording (Windows WASAPI loopback)
pyaudiowpatch>=0.2.12.4  # PyAudio fork with WASAPI loopback support

# Transcription (Windows with CUDA support)
faster-whisper>=1.0.0    # Fast, accurate Whisper implementation (CPU + GPU)

# GPU Acceleration (Optional but recommended for faster transcription)
# For NVIDIA GPU users with CUDA installed:
# 1. Install PyTorch with CUDA support first:
#    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
#
# 2. Then install CuBLAS and cuDNN for faster-whisper:
#    pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12
#
# Note: These are large downloads (~2-4GB total) but provide 4-5x speedup
